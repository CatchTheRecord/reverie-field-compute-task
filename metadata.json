{"author":"Reverie Field Project","description":"Run a Reverie Field Project game task to earn $SONO KPL tokens. This task synchronizes and validates player data for the \"Reverie Field\" game, a decentralized platform where players earn rewards by participating in in-game activities. The task fetches player data from the server, caches it, and submits it to IPFS for validation. A lenient validation process allows up to 10% tolerance for discrepancies, ensuring fair reward distribution even with minor data differences.","repositoryUrl":"https://github.com/CatchTheRecord/reverie-field-compute-task","createdAt":1726404608246,"imageUrl":"https://indigo-eldest-dingo-769.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdeYMo2aBQt9Qox5bMCNnh53jDxiZA5jnLMcJb6WLrx42","infoUrl":"infoUrl","requirementsTags":[{"type":"CPU","value":"2-core"},{"type":"RAM","value":"1 GB"},{"type":"STORAGE","value":"1 GB"}]}
